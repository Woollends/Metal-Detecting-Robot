# Metal-Detecting-Robot
Designed a remote-controlled metal-detecting robot with autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance. Coded the controller with master-slave communication between PIC32 and STM microcontrollers, assembled hardware with an H-Bridge for servo control, and developed a Python-based movement visualization. Extensively tested for accuracy.
